This is my current HBS BT mod project. What it does is mainly attempt to make the game harder while remaining balanced.

This mod requires the Community Asset Bundle (which also needs BT performance fix until the assetbundles get redone) 
Community Asset Bundle: https://www.nexusmods.com/battletech/mods/393
BT Performance Fix: https://github.com/m22spencer/BattletechPerformanceFix/releases

My notes on all my changes (it is of varying degrees of truth, due to neglecting to update it): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Opy3nxGoNRKgZXpHGaTWGGk4KBSiL4Ot5lDEs4cPvxU/edit

Everything done by me:

- Weapon changes
- Weapon additions made possible by Weapon Realizer, and CAC
- More mech variants, lots and lots of mech variants
- More vehicle variants
- More turret types
- Shop changes
- Skill changes
- Equipment changes
- Base campaign made to be a lot harder. (still in progress)


Everything that's not done by me.

- took and modified NARC, TAG, MASC, and Supercharger from Roguetech.
- a whole bunch of chassisdefs, mechdefs, vehicledefs, ect. that've changed here and there from JK, bloodydoves, Colobos, Backfish, and I think that's all?

- And anyone else i've probably forgotten about.
